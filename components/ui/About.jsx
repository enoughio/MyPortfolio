              Hii Again,
              <br />
              I'm Aniket.

              <p>
                I'm a web developer based in Bhopal, passionate about how people
                and software can work together to improve lives. I work as a
                freelancer with a small team, where I build and optimize web
                applications for businesses.
              </p>

              <p>
                Previously, I worked as an individual developer. During that
                time, I also gained some experience with design, which helps me
                create more user-friendly interfaces.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a developer, I enjoy being a generalist with a strong focus
                on clean code and scalable architecture. I value well-structured
                systems backed by efficient and maintainable solutions. I love
                the idea that software is an evolving entity, constantly
                improving over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of work, I have a deep appreciation
                for food. I enjoy exploring new restaurants, being around people
                who experiment with new technologies, and  <i className="font-thin">writing</i> â€”I write a lot
                sometimes.
